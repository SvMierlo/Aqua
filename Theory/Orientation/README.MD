Orientation
---

This folder contains some simple orientation on several subjects. Think about power-efficiency, lora-shields/adapters, case-design, 3d-printing materials etc...  
The orientation should give us a clearer path in which we want to develop the MFM.

Below is a list of important subjects:

 - Power supply (This is quite broad)
  - Power storage (batteries)
  - Power generating (solar panels/chemical reactions/etc.)
  - What to do in case of total power loss.
 - Lora-shields/adapters for arduino (What shields/adapters are cheap but reliable and applicable)
 - case-design (Box, pyramid, half-pyramid etc.)
 - 3d-printer materials (to withstand vandalism and heavy storms etc.)
 - *Further expand this list*
